  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <img src="images/self pic.jpg" class="centered-image">
  <div class="border-box">
  <p>My name is <strong>Steven Galvan</strong> and I'm a people leader and programmer in training. I've had the pleasure of leading large non-technical teams, but have always been intrigued by more technical work. After shadowing several product and project managers, and researching technical leader roles, I decided to pause on my career and focus on developing my technical fluency to lead teams in more effective ways. I joined <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/" target="_blank">Epicodus</a> in January, 2023, and I've really been enjoying the program! I hope you enjoy reviewing my portfolio. Thanks!</p></div>

  <h2>My Education & Background</h2>
  <div class="border-box2">
    <p>I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Marketing from the Univerversity of Texas at El Paso. Shortly after, I returned to graduate school where I earned a Master of Science degree in Internet Marketing. Since then, I've gone to work in several small and large organizations. I've been leading large teams for Bonobos and Stitch Fix (fashion tech) for the past 6 years.</p></div>

I was able to take my learnings from this week and tie things together. I included columns, sidebar, images, and some div & span elements. It was a lot of fun bringing these concepts to life!</p>
