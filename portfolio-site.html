  <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio of Projects Created for Epicodus</h2>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>My name is Steven Galvan and I'm a people leader and programmer in training. I've had the pleasure of leading large non-technical teams, but have always been intrigued by more technical work. After shadowing several product and project managers, and researching technical leader roles, I decided to pause on my career and focus on developing my technical fluency to lead teams in more effective ways. I joined Epicodus in January, 2023, and I've really been enjoying the program! I hope you enjoy reviewing my portfolio. Thanks!</p>
