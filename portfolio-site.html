  <p>My name is <strong>Steven Galvan</strong> and I'm a people leader and programmer in training. I've had the pleasure of leading large non-technical teams, but have always been intrigued by more technical work. After shadowing several product and project managers, and researching technical leader roles, I decided to pause on my career and focus on developing my technical fluency to lead teams in more effective ways. I joined <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/" target="_blank">Epicodus</a> in January, 2023, and I've really been enjoying the program! I hope you enjoy reviewing my portfolio. Thanks!</p></div>
